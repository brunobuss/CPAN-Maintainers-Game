This is a game for 2-4 players, based on mechanics of Monopoly Deal[1].

The theme of the game is that players are (new) CPAN Maintainers and they want to maintain the coolest modules in CPAN (you know, Perl programmers loves Perl).
As in Monopoly Deal, all modules have one color and the objective is to complete 3 full sets.

Of course, this game is made in Perl, with SDL for the client :)
